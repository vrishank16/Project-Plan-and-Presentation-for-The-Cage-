# Project-Plan-and-Presentation-for-The-Cage
This project involved me and my team to take on the role of a project management team to produce a project plan for our client. In this instance the project plan provided a detailed plan of the management of a proposed project. It was developed to provide the client with a detailed insight of how a proposed project will be managed. Additionally, we presented our plan to the audience of project stakeholders, so they could determine if they wanted to proceed with the project as elaborated in the plan. 

### Case Summary
In this case, our client was 'The Cage', an SME operating in Singapore. Incorporated in 2005, the company manages indoor soccer stadiums by renting soccer stadium slots through phone and on-site bookings. Sanjay Danani and his two other friends founded the company after he spotted a business opportunity offering indoor sporting facilities to connect people through sports. He has leveraged on their first mover advantage, and The Cage continues to be a leader in the field. From its flagship premises in Kallang, the company has since expanded to the former Turf Club at Bukit Timah, providing state-of-the-art sports facilities within a 90,000 m2 site.

Over time, The Cage’s competition has picked up. In 2017, more than 20 venues operated by its competitors were available. To adapt to this fierce competition and customers’ demand, The Cage continues to evolve and adapt to new ideas. Besides football, it now offers indoor cricket on a futsal pitch, bubble soccer and archery tag. The Cage’s management intends to host more services and options. The company continues to be innovative and keep in close touch with its customers and remains true to its mission of connecting people through sports

The goal of this project plan is to strategically incorporate advanced DA capabilities into The Cage's operations. 

Some Additional details provided regarding the case: It is believed that the DA project is expected to be commenced and fully implemented within 8 months with a working deadline of the end of this year. The budget is set at $1.5 million dollars. Additionally, it is expected that you will work with the VU Information Systems Corporation to get both hardware and software installed. Complete testing including acceptance testing shall then be carried out before finally implementing the DA systems across all countrywide branches and the headquarters.
